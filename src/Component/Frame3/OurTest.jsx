                            One-size-fits-all advice doesn't work. So we'll 
                            provide you with the most advanced analysis of your gut bacteria,
                            blood sugar and blood fats available. We'll then compare your results 
                            to thousands of other people we've tested. Using patented techniques 
                            you can't get anywhere else.

                        to make smart combos each week, using insights from your tests
